Hi,

I have been using wordpress as my blogging platfom for some time now.

While its an ageing platform, it served a very awesome purpose. Now, however, its time to move into something newer, that allows me greater freedom, to be awesome + github yay !!

For now, until i can figure out the moving part, I am keeping older blogs back there. You can read them on [my old blog](https://mohammedzee1000.wordpress.com/).

Keep it touch guys :)
